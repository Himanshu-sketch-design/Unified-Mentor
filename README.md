I successfully completed multiple tasks involving data analysis, data visualization, machine learning

Task 1 :

  About Dataset
  This dataset encompasses over 500 user comments collected from high-performing posts on NASA's Facebook page dedicated to climate change. The comments, gathered from various posts between 2020 and 2023, offer a   diverse range of public opinions and sentiments about climate change and NASA's related activities.

  Data Science Applications

  Despite not being a large dataset, it offers valuable opportunities for analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Potential applications include:

  ● Sentiment Analysis: Gauge public opinion on climate change and NASA's communication strategies.
  ● Trend Analysis: Identify shifts in public sentiment over the specified period.
  ● Engagement Analysis: Understand the correlation between the content of a post and user engagement.
  ● Topic Modeling: Discover prevalent themes in public discourse about climate change.

  Column Descriptors

  1. Date: The date and time when the comment was posted.
  2. LikesCount: The number of likes each comment received.
  3. ProfileName: The anonymized name of the user who posted the comment.
  4. CommentsCount: The number of responses each comment received.
  5. Text: The actual text content of the comment.

Task 2 : 

  About Dataset
  This dataset contains comprehensive information on over 248,000 medical drugs from all manufacturers available worldwide. The data includes details such as drug names, active ingredients, therapeutic uses,     
  dosage, side effects, and substitutes. The dataset aims to provide a useful resource for medical researchers, healthcare professionals, and drug manufacturers.
  
  The dataset contains the following information for each drug:

  1. Drug name
  2. Adverse reactions and side effects
  3. Drug interactions
  4. Drug class
  5. Substitute drugs
  6. Active ingredients

  Dataset Related Info.:

  1. There are total of 5 substitutes columns in the dataset.
  2. There are total of 41 Side Effects columns in the dataset. Drugs with less side effects have those columns as blank.
  3. There are total of 5 usage columns in the dataset.
  4. Rest Columns have their own individual identity.

Task 3 :

  About Dataset
  The "OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data" is a comprehensive collection of information pertaining to 1500 individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This dataset encompasses a   wide range of parameters, providing a detailed insight into the demographic and clinical profiles of these individuals. Included in this dataset are key demographic details such as age, gender, ethnicity,     
  marital status, and education level, offering a comprehensive overview of the sample population. Additionally, clinical information like the date of OCD diagnosis, duration of symptoms, and any previous 
  psychiatric diagnoses are recorded, providing context to the patients' journeys. The dataset also delves into the specific nature of OCD symptoms, categorizing them into obsession and compulsion types. Severity 
  of these symptoms is assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive

  Scale (Y-BOCS) scores for both obsessions and compulsions. Furthermore, it documents any co-occurring mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety diagnoses. Notably, the dataset outlines the 
  medications prescribed to patients, offering valuable insights into the treatment approaches employed. It also records whether there is a family history of OCD, shedding light on potential genetic or 
  environmental factors.

  Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and mental health professionals seeking to gain a deeper understanding of OCD and its manifestations within a diverse patient 
  population.
